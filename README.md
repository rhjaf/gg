# D3
Implementation of D3 article

Current Issues:
- [ ] the sqrt method in math.h library will break the code ( It is used to calculate the variance)
- [ ] the sliding window of R and V doesn't fully understand
- [ ] appending ratio metrics R and actual v in the case of no DDoS doesn't understand
- [ ] Is it able to detect the victims or just trigger the alert
- [ ] It currently just triggers the alert because the IP keys are not stored anywhere we just use their hash to index and count the throughput
